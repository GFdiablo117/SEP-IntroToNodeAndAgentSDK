# Testing

This chapter should provide a short introduction on testing in NodeJS and JavaScript. We picked two of the most-prominent JavaScript testing frameworks - Mocha and Jasmine.

## Setup 

First, start by downloading the required dependencies for each project by switching to its folder (`$ cd Mocha | cd Jasmine`) and then executing `$ yarn install`. Now you are able to run the tests.

## Mocha & Chai

* [Getting started](https://mochajs.org/)

```Code
$ cd ./Mocha
$ yarn test
```

## Jasmine

* [Getting started](https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html)
* [Introduction snippets](https://jasmine.github.io/2.0/introduction.html)

```Code
$ cd ./Jasmine
$ yarn test
```
